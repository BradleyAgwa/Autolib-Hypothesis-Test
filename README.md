# Autolib-Hypothesis-Test

###### By Bradley Agwa

## Description
Autolib is an electric car sharing company. The company has 3 main types of electric cars: blue cars, utilib counter and the utilib 4 counter. These cars operate in Paris, France.
The claim is that the mean number of blue cars returned in a certain area is equal to the mean of the returned blue cars from another area during weekends.
The company has tasked us to do an investigation to clearly determine the truth in this so as to aid in planning the marketing strategies and segmentation in different areas and maximize profit.
